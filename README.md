# 💡 Learn What Matters: C/C++ Core Programming Course

Welcome to **Learn What Matters** – a focused, hands-on C/C++ course that teaches the **low-level fundamentals** that are essential for writing efficient, bug-free, and real-world-ready code.

Instead of jumping into Object-Oriented Programming or complex libraries, this course brings you back to the **core of programming**: how memory works, how arrays and pointers interact, and how C-style logic still forms the backbone of modern C++.

---

## 🚀 Topics You Will Master

🧠 **Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA)**  
Understand how memory works using `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, `new`, `delete`, and how to avoid memory leaks.

📍 **Pointers & Pointer Arithmetic**  
Single, double, and even triple pointers; pointer to arrays, pointer to functions, and how memory is accessed directly.

🔢 **Arrays & Strings (C-style)**  
Manipulating arrays and strings using loops, pointers, and functions — building your own versions of `strlen`, `strcpy`, etc.

🔁 **Function Design & Overloading Basics**  
Passing by value/reference/pointer, function overloading in C++, and understanding inline and recursive functions.

🧩 **Memory Layout of Variables**  
Stack vs Heap, scope & lifetime, static/global memory, and how variables are actually arranged in RAM.


This repo contains questions related to Dynamic Memory Allocation, Functions (Overloading, Inline, Pass by Reference, Return by Reference), Namespace, Reference Variables, Structures, Arrays, Pointers.
